1) I suppose strings are the same as lists in that they can both store many values. Where a list stores values in neat separated boxes, a string just stores all of its values in immediate succession in the same box.

2) List comprehensions run faster than a for loop that appends objects to a list. Additionally, they save space in your code and look very clean.

3) Here is the code I used
... try:
...     import matplotlib
... except Exception as e:
...     print('rasied error:',e)
And matplotlib was successfully imported, with version 3.0.2.

4) For numerical arrays u and v of the same size,
using enumerate

dot_prod = 0
    for i,x in enumerate(u):
        dot_prod += x*v[i]
    return dot_prod

using zip

dot_prod = 0
    for i,j in zip(u,v):
        dot_prod += i*j
    return dot_prod

I like zip a little better, because it saves me the extra step of trying to figure out how to make the correct entries talk to each other.
